1) Option 1. We would fit the automated tests in our recipe project development pipeline within the github actions. This is because we want to ensure that as we push to the repository, our code is getting tested that we push. This would automate the tests and save us the manual work. If we run the tests after the development is done, we will likely see bugs that could have been prevented through the development process with constant testing.
   
2) I wouldn't use end-to-end testing just for testing out the functionality of a single function. This is because E2E testing will run cases from start to finish on the program, and we only want to make sure that the function we are testing has the right output. It can be used, but it is too much for one singular simple test for a function output and can take way too long
   
3) No, this is because messaging is a key aspect to the entire process of a messaging app. We don't just want to see how the feature works in a vacuum, we want to see how it works on an application / broad level and see how it interacts with the rest of the application.
   
4) Yes, because this condition is simple and a simple case to test. We don't need to see how the application functions based on a character limit of messages.
